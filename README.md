# Softgames Tech Test - Lucas Jones

I chose to use PixiJS v8 for this project to get hands-on with the new API and PixiLayout. I limited myself to a few hours total, which made it tough to go deep on any one task. 
Given more time, I would‚Äôve focused on a single area and polished it further. Most of my time went into Magic Words, exploring and experimenting with the layout system.

### üÉè Ace of Shadows

I used springs to give the cards a satisfying feel when moving, added a shader background from [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XXtBRr), and included sound effects for a bit of extra polish.


#### Potential Improvements
 - Missing features card animation from deck-to-deck

### ‚ú® Magic Words

This is the one I spent the most time on, as I wanted to try out PixiLayout - It uses Yoga for a flex-box style layout engine, it was really impressive.

#### Potential Improvements

- Investigate [SplitText/SplitBitmapText](https://pixijs.com/8.x/guides/components/scene-objects/text/split-text)
- Typewriter animation for text (and talking sound effect like Animal Crossing, Celeste, Undertale)
- Per word animations [Example](https://github.com/LeiQiaoZhi/Easy-Text-Effects-for-Unity)
- Emotion-based avatar tweens (angry - shake, happy bounce)


### üî• Phoenix Flame

I ran out of time to build a custom solution, but still wanted something in place; since I noticed Softgames uses RevoltFX, I quickly integrated it and added a basic fire effect.

#### Potential Improvements
- Custom particle system
- Use ParticleContainer for fast rendering
- Use a SpriteSheet for single draw call if multiple textures are needed
- Use a shader/filter to improve visuals (bloom)

### üöÄ Overall Improvements
- TexturePacker integration
- PixiJS AssetPack implementation
- Enum-based asset management (eliminate magic strings asset references)
- Complete mobile responsiveness (could use PixiLayout)
- Full-Screen support
- FPS viewer
